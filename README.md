#####Challenges :

The main challenges I faced with this asignment were: **editing the carousel**, **implementing images to the grid and have it bahave properly**, **manipulating the size of the form's input fields**.


**Carousel** : The Carousel was difficult to wrap my head around in terms of how it was constructed and which parts I had to edit in order to get it to work like the original. also when resized the controls would disappear.

-

**Grid** : the grid was a bit difficult in the sense that it would not respond the way I wanted it to. it looked fine when the page was at full size but as I shrunk it down to different sizes it wouldn't go from 2 rows to 2 columns like the original site did. 

After inspecting the site to better understand how the original site was built and trying different ways, using css grid and just using bootstrap rows and columns, I decided to go with the bootstrap approach because it gave me a grid that behaved almost like the actual grid on the site.

-
**Form** : my main struggle with the form was that I couldn't get the input field for the phone number to align with the other fields. 

I tried different approaches before I realised that my column class was wrong and that I needed to adjust my margins as well (See Below)

#####Take-Aways :

Overall I'm very pleased with the end product. I did struggle a little with the above mentioned sections but I'm confident that I'll be more comfortable with a bit more practice and getting better understanding bootstrap built-in classes will make everything run much smoother. Time and task management went a lot better with this project, Trello was a huge help I'll be definitely using that in my future projects. Compared to the start of the week I feel much more comfortable with html, css and bootstrap and as I said before I believe with practice and time I'll feel much more confident using these languages. Overall I give this asignment 7/10.
